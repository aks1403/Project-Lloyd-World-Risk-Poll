# Lloyd's World Risk Poll Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Lloyd's World Risk Poll" project. The project involved analyzing data from the 2021 Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll to understand people's attitudes, experiences, and behaviors related to risk and safety. The analysis aimed to uncover global trends impacting resilience indices across diverse nations and develop predictive models for resilience indices.

## Data Description
- The dataset consists of data from 143 countries divided into 15 regions.
- Over 70 questions were posed to more than 280,000 residents worldwide.
- The selected independent variables included 17 main features, which were carefully chosen using feature selection methods.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project were:
1. Analyzing Global Trends Impacting Resilience Indices Across Diverse Nations.
2. Utilizing Linear Regression for Predictive Modeling.
3. Comparative Analysis of Higher-Order Models Versus Linear Models.

## Methodology
The project methodology included several key steps:
1. Data Acquisition: Obtaining the 2021 Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll dataset from 143 countries.
2. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant independent variables and removing irrelevant or redundant ones.
3. Assumption Validation: Validating Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression assumptions.
4. Linear Regression: Using linear regression to model the impact of independent variables on the Resilience Index.
5. Polynomial Regression: Exploring polynomial regression and determining its suitability.
6. Regularization: Applying L1 regularization for model refinement and hyperparameter tuning.
